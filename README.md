# LastGithubIssueNumber

This is a simple script that relies on [Hub](https://hub.github.com/) and prints out the last Github issue number for
the current git repository.

## Installation

`gem install last_github_issue_number`

## Configuration

Just make sure you have Hub configured correctly and `hub browse -u` works.

## Usage

`last_github_issue_number`

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
